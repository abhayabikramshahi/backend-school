# Apache Configuration for Render.com

## Fixing mod_rewrite Issues

If you're seeing errors related to `RewriteEngine` or other Apache directives on Render.com, follow these steps:

### 1. Check if mod_rewrite is enabled

Visit the diagnostic page on your deployed site:
```
https://your-app-name.onrender.com/mod_rewrite_check.php
```

### 2. Update your render.yaml file

If mod_rewrite is not enabled, you may need to modify your `render.yaml` file to include Apache configuration. Add the following to your `startCommand`:

```yaml
startCommand: |
  echo "LoadModule rewrite_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_rewrite.so" > apache_config
  vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 -C apache_config .
```

### 3. Alternative approach

If you continue to have issues with .htaccess, consider implementing URL routing in PHP instead:

1. Create a front controller (e.g., `index.php`) that handles all requests
2. Use PHP to parse the URL and route to appropriate controllers
3. This approach doesn't rely on Apache's mod_rewrite

### 4. Contact Render.com Support

If you've tried the above solutions and still have issues, contact Render.com support for assistance with your specific deployment configuration.

## Current Configuration Status

Your .htaccess file has been updated to:

1. Only use RewriteEngine if mod_rewrite is available
2. Use compatible syntax for Apache 2.2 and 2.4+
3. Properly handle file access restrictions

These changes should prevent the "Invalid command 'RewriteEngine'" error.
